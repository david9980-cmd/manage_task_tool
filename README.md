# Project Title

## Overview

This project contains both a **frontend** and **backend** for a Task Mangement application.

### Folder Structure
- **frontend/**: Contains all the frontend code (React, Typescript, MUI, etc).
- **backend/**: Contains all the backend code (Python with FastAPI).

## Setup Instructions

### 1. **Frontend Setup**
The frontend is typically built with React/TypeScript. To set up the frontend, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3. To run the frontend application in development mode:
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```

4. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` (or another port depending on your configuration) to view the frontend.

### 2. **Backend Setup**
The backend can be built with various technologies (Python with FastAPI).

1. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (for Python projects):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. To run the backend server:
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```

    This assumes you have a `main.py` file with the FastAPI app instance (`app`).

5. The backend will run at `http://localhost:8000` (or the specified port). You can test it using your frontend or directly with API testing tools like Postman or cURL.
